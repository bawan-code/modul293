            <h2>The Author</h2>
            <p><img src="./assets/img/brando.jpg" alt="brando" style="float: right;">
                <em><strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong></em> is a prolific and highly regarded American author of fantasy
                and science fiction, renowned for his intricate magic systems, expansive worldbuilding, and methodical,
                tightly structured storytelling.
                <br><br>
                Born in 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska, Sanderson developed a love for fantasy literature early
                in life and later honed his craft at Brigham Young University, where he earned an M.F.A. in creative
                writing. He rose to prominence with the success of his <em>Mistborn</em> trilogy, a series celebrated
                for its
                unique magical mechanics and compelling characters.
                <br><br>
                Sanderson further solidified his place in the genre’s pantheon when he was chosen to complete <em>The
                    Wheel
                    of Time</em> series after the death of its original author, <em>Robert Jordan</em>—a monumental task
                that introduced
                his work to a broader audience and earned him critical acclaim. Beyond individual series, Sanderson is
                the architect of <span class="cosmereText">The Cosmere</span>, a sprawling, interconnected universe in
                which many of his novels take
                place. This shared setting features subtle links and a hidden overarching narrative that rewards
                dedicated readers with deeper layers of meaning.
                <br><br>
                Known for his prodigious output and detailed worldbuilding, Sanderson has become one of the most
                influential figures in modern speculative fiction, continually pushing the boundaries of the genre.

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p><img src="./assets/img/cosmereLogo.png" alt="cosmereLogo" style="float: left;">
                <span class="cosmereText">The Cosmere</span> is an ambitious and intricately designed shared universe
                created by Brandon Sanderson,
                spanning multiple series and stand-alone novels. These include <em>Mistborn</em>, <em>The Stormlight
                    Archive</em>,
                <em>Elantris</em>, and <em>Warbreaker</em>, among others. Each story is set on a distinct planet,
                complete with its own
                unique cultures, histories, and meticulously crafted magic systems. While each series can be enjoyed
                independently, they are all subtly interconnected through a deeper, hidden narrative thread that unfolds
                across the larger Cosmere universe.
                <br><br>
                At the heart of this overarching mythos lies the concept of the <em>Shards of Adonalsium</em>—fragments
                of a
                divine power that were scattered across the cosmos, each influencing the worlds they inhabit in
                different ways. A number of recurring elements, such as the enigmatic world-hopper <em>Hoid</em>,
                mysterious
                organizations, and characters capable of traveling between planets, serve to link the stories together
                and hint at the Cosmere's greater scope.
                <br><br>
                Thematically, Sanderson’s Cosmere novels delve into profound questions surrounding divinity, power,
                identity, moral choice, and the cost of sacrifice. These philosophical undercurrents are seamlessly
                woven into narratives that feature intricate plots, vivid settings, and emotionally resonant character
                arcs. Sanderson’s masterful ability to blend these elements into a coherent and evolving universe has
                not only captivated readers but also helped redefine the possibilities of epic fantasy storytelling in
                the modern era.
