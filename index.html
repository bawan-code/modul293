            <h2>The Author</h2>
            <p><em><strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong></em> is a prolific American fantasy and science fiction author,
                best known for his intricate
                magic systems, expansive worldbuilding, and methodical storytelling. Born in 1975 in Nebraska, he gained
                widespread recognition with his <em>Mistborn</em> series and for completing <em>Robert Jordan’s The
                    Wheel of Time</em>
                after Jordan’s death. He is also the creator of <span class="cosmereText">The Cosmere</span>, a vast
                shared universe that connects many
                of his novels through a hidden overarching narrative.

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p><span class="cosmereText">The Cosmere</span> spans multiple series and stand-alone books, including
                Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive,
                Elantris, and Warbreaker. Each takes place on a different planet with its own unique magic system, but
                they are all subtly linked by a deeper story involving god-like entities called Shards of Adonalsium,
                recurring characters like the mysterious Hoid, and the ability of some characters to travel between
                worlds. Thematically, the books explore questions of divinity, power, identity, and sacrifice, all while
                delivering compelling plots and rich character arcs. Sanderson’s ability to weave these elements into a
                cohesive, interconnected universe has made him a defining voice in modern fantasy.</p>
